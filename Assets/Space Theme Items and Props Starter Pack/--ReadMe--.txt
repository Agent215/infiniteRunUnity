Space Theme Items and Props Starter Pack
Hi and thanks for purchasing, I hope you enjoy the pack as much as I enjoyed making it :)
Contact me at tenton3d@gmail.com - I'm happy to help or hear about any imrpovements / ideas on the pack.

---Rendering in the promo images---
The assets are supplied in a default scene setup. In the screenshots, I used the 'Unity Essentials' 'Post Processing Stack' with 'Antialiasing', 'Ambient Occlusion', 'Screen Space Reflection', 'Bloom' and 'colour grading' ticked and set to the starting values.
Stack found here - https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/83912

Set camera to 'Deffered' in the rendering path for full effects :)

--Materials--
This poly style pack uses one 512 atlas texture. View 'guide1.jpg' for extra info. 'Traffic Green' 'Traffic Red' 'Traffic Orange' are assigned to the 'Traffic Light' prefab. This is so you can animate the values if you wish

--Star--
Shooting star uses a simple trail renderer, so if you were to animate the effect will be visable.

Thanks again
